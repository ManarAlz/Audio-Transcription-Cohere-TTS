# Audio-Transcription-Cohere-TTS
This project converts audio input into text using OpenAI's Whisper model, generates a natural language response with Cohere's language model, and then converts that response back to speech using Google's Text-to-Speech (gTTS) service. It demonstrates an end-to-end pipeline for audio understanding and interactive response generation.
